//Story: As a player, I want to be notified if I crash into a 
//celestial body or artifact so I know I have lost the game
//Acceptance Criteria:
//1. Verify that if the spacecraft is moved to a location where it 
//is sharing the same Celestial Point as a celestial body or artifact, a 
//message is sent to the user and the game ends.

//notes: objects: player objects, celestial bodies, artifacts, 
// what looks for collisions?
////choices: 
////player object
////map objects (celestials, artifacts, planets, other?)

//naive approach:
//take my position and check it against every item on the map

function collisionDetection(){
