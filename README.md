# SpaceHunt 
## A space-based role playing game for one player.

In SpaceHunt, the player commands the Galactic Schooner, OldSpice. The goal of the game is to locate the ancient recipe for Koca-Kola which was stolen by BadMax and his interstellar gang of henchmen, and hidden on an unknown planet in the Pentium System. While it is unknown which of Pentiumâ€™s seven planets (Pentium-1 through Pentium-7) holds the secret recipe, the strong box containing the prize is fitted with a transmitter that sends out a beacon. This beacon can be detected aboard OldSpice when it is within orbital distance of the planet.
